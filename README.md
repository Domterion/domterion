âœ¨ About me
Hellow, I am Dominic but usually go by Dom or Mellow. I am just a wannabe programmer. I love [Crystal-lang](https://crystal-lang.org/). I also dabble with html and (s)css, my website can be found [here](https://dominiquecat.com/). I also have three cats Tank, Mrap and Pink Nose. Cats are my life. I also love to play Minecraft, specifically on Hypixel. 

ðŸ˜º Projects
I currently have no major projects going. Just my weird side projects. One of my favorite so far was [CliQR](https://github.com/Domterion/CliQR), a Cli QR code generator. It's not much but It was fun and a nice side project.

ðŸ’» Hardware
Mouse: Glorious Model O
Headset: Arctis Pro + GameDAC
Keyboard: GMMK Compact
Monitor: Acer SB220Q and Sceptre E255B-1658A
PC: 16gb memory (3000MHz), Ryzen 5 2600X and PowerColor Red Dragon Radeon RX 570.

I want to eventually build a custom keyboard as It has interested me and I love how good they can look and sound.
